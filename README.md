# Shapes Relay

This project is a relay interface between Discord bots and the [Shapes API](https://shapes.inc), allowing you to integrate multimodal AI (text, image, voice) into your bot **without directly violating Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service**.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and learning purposes only.  
> It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Shapes Inc.  
> **Do not sell or commercialize this relay in any form.**

## ‚ùó Important Recommendation

**Use an ALT account to create and operate your bot.**  
Even though this relay minimizes detection risks, there is no absolute guarantee that Discord won‚Äôt detect or flag the interaction in the future.

Using an alternate account ensures your main account remains safe.

## ‚úÖ What does Shapes Relay do?

- Receives formatted payloads from Discord bots
- Forwards the content to [Shapes API](https://api.shapes.inc/v1/)
